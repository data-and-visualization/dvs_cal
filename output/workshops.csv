Ethics of Data Management and Sharing,"Thursday, September 9, 2021",10:00am - 12:00pm,Jen Darragh & Sophia Lafferty-Hess,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/8061418?hs=a,"[Online] This workshop will explore the many different ethical issues that can arise with data management and sharing and strategies to address those issues. Topics covered will include a framework for analyzing ethical cases, the use of secondary data in research, proper consent procedures, de-identification, and the impact of laws on data sharing. We will also explore the application of diversity and equity principles to open science and data sharing. For instance, how can researchers ethically collect, handle, and share data from certain communities, such as Indeginous People?

Tips for Effective Data Visualization,"Monday, September 13, 2021",5:00pm - 6:30pm,Eric Monson,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/8057793?hs=a,"[Online] Visualization is a powerful way to reveal patterns in data, attract attention, and get your message across to an audience quickly and clearly. But, there are many steps in that journey from exploration to information to influence, and many choices to make when putting it all together to tell your story. I will cover some basic guidelines for effective visualization, point out a few common pitfalls to avoid, and run through a critique and iterations of an existing visualization to help you start seeing better choices beyond the program defaults.

Tableau for Survey Data: Likert Scales,"Tuesday, September 21, 2021",10:00am - 12:00pm,Eric Monson,Bostock 023 Training Room,https://duke.libcal.com/event/8057894?hs=a,"[In-person] Tableau is one of the easiest and most flexible programs for visualizing and exploring data. This exploration stage of visualization is essential for finding the patterns in your data that you want to investigate and communicate to your audience. Likert scale survey data, where respondents have given answers on a scale about how much they agree with a statement, or how important something is to them (e.g. strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree) presents a wonderful example for learning intermediate Tableau skills!

What you’ll learn:

In this workshop we’ll transform survey data from Qualtrics in preparation for visualization, join (relate) multiple tables in Tableau, and build some effective visualizations for Likert scale survey results.

It’s not absolutely necessary, but if you’ve never used Tableau before, you may want to view my Introduction to Tableau workshop video before attending.

Bring a computer if you can!

We hope there will be some computers in the training room with Tableau Public installed, but if you have a laptop with a recent (from the past six months) version of Tableau Public (or Desktop) installed, that will lessen the chance that you’ll have to share machines. You can easily download Tableau Public for free from https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/download (you just need to supply them with your email address). Students can apply for a yearly renewable license (It takes a few days to receive the license, so don’t wait until the last minute to apply.)

As a native 64-bit program, it also has superior performance. There are a few nice feature enhancements such as multiple layouts in a single project, and it's more fully integrated with ArcGIS Online (see schedule for workshops on ArcGIS Online or on StoryMaps).

ArcGIS Pro can help you analyze or visualize digital data that has a locational component, and we'll discuss starting points for obtaining data. Examples will focus on social science data and feature (vector) layers, but attendees are encouraged to ask questions regarding their own needs and will be welcome to make one-on-one appointments later for more focused instruction. This is an introductory class, and it's not necessary to be familiar with GIS software beforehand.

This workshop will be held in person in Bostock Library (room 023, in the basement corridor leading to Perkins), but may move to virtual depending on Duke Coronavirus policies, health or equipment considerations. Please watch your email for updates. All participants are required to follow current Duke Coronavirus policies to attend the workshop. 

There 15 computers available, and attendees are welcome to bring laptops if they've loaded necessary software. Attendees using their own computers should have access to ArcGIS Pro. These are the options for Duke affiliates:

OIT Download: Current Duke University students, faculty, and staff can get a free copy to install on their own Windows computer, or a Mac with virtual machine software installed (e.g., VMware or Parallels).
	Virtual Computing Manager (VCM) from Duke's Office of Information Technology (OIT) allows Duke users to check out a virtual machine with ArcGIS installed and connect via a remote connection.

Visualization in Python with Altair,"Wednesday, October 6, 2021",10:00am - 12:00pm,Eric Monson,Bostock 023 Training Room,https://duke.libcal.com/event/8057907?hs=a,"[In-person] While Python is my preferred programming language for scripted data transformations, I have avoided routinely doing data visualization in Python. I could follow examples for the many Python visualization libraries, but in the end they all seemed confusing and made it hard to do the types of exploratory visualization that Tableau made easy. Finally, Altair has emerged as a viable alternative for me, because of the way it ""thinks about"" data and the visualization process.

Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, built on top of the well-design and powerful Vega-Lite visualization grammar. (Vega-lite was built for the web, includes interaction, and is being adopted as a standard by high profile websites and tools.) It works well for small to medium-sized tabular data (like spreadsheets). 

In this workshop, I’ll run you through both some introductory and some more complex examples using Altair with Python in Jupyter notebooks, so you can get a feeling for how you might use it in your own work. 

Note: This is an introductory workshop on Altair, but you’ll probably be more comfortable following along if you have at least a little bit of experience using the Python programming language, since I won’t be spending time on the language itself. (Feel free to sign up no matter what your experience level, but past students with no Python or programming experience have found it too confusing to be useful.) 

Altair web site: https://altair-viz.github.io/
	Blog post, “Why I’m backing Vega-Lite as our default tool for data visualization”: https://medium.com/@robin.linacre/why-im-backing-vega-lite-as-our-default-tool-for-data-visualisation-51c20970df39
Bring a computer if you can!

We hope there will be some computers in the training room with Python installed, but if you have a laptop with recent (from the past six months) versions of Python, Jupyter Lab and Altair installed, that will lessen the chance that you’ll have to share machines. Instructions are below.

Anaconda Python distribution (Individual Edition): https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

I strongly recommend that you install the Anaconda Python Distribution to use in class. In principle, if you have something above Python 3.7 or so, plus all the necessary modules, everything should work fine. But, the Anaconda Distribution is packaged nicely, can be installed without admin privileges, and comes with everything you’ll need. If you have another version of Python already installed and you’re going to install Anaconda, it’s best to uninstall the other version first. It can get to be a mess if you have multiple versions of Python installed on one machine. 

Go to the link above, hit Download, and choose the version for your operating system. I would recommend to just install for “yourself”, not for all users of the machine, since that way it will install everything in your Users/username folder and doesn’t require admin privileges. 
	If you’re on Mac and aren’t comfortable with shell scripts on the command line, choose the Graphical Installer. 
	On Windows, I would choose the 64-bit installer, unless you know you’re still running a 32-bit version of Windows on an older machine. 
	If you’re sticking with your non-Anaconda version of Python, make sure you have JupyterLab, Pandas, Altair, and all of their respective dependencies installed.
Please try to launch Python and JupyterLab before class to make sure they’re working! JupyterLab can be started from the Anaconda Navigator application, or from the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or a Terminal (Mac) by typing (without quotes) “jupyter lab” and hitting return. From a Python notebook or an interactive Python prompt, you can test out the main modules you’ll need by typing this and executing the code cell:

import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
