NIH implemented a new Data Management and Sharing Policy in early 2023 and other funding agencies, such as NSF, are implementing revised public access and data sharing policies in early 2025 to comply with the “Nelson Memo.” This workshop will cover the components of a data management and sharing plan, what makes a strong plan and how to adhere to it, and where to find guidance, tools, resources, and assistance for building funder-based plans. We will also discuss how to make data management plans actionable and meaningful living documents to support research integrity, reproducibility, reuse, and verification of results. This workshop is a collaboration of Duke University Libraries, the Office of Scientific Integrity, and the Medical Center Libraries and Archives. This event is open to non-Duke participants.

We will spend workshop time covering the context for Polars, common data manipulation processes, and close by considering possibilities of using Polars as part of a larger data workflow. This event is open to non-Duke participants.

NOTES AND CONSIDERATIONS:

If you wish to follow along with the examples and exercises in the workshop, please bring a laptop.
	Participants who have previous experience with data manipulation libraries in python and R (for example: pandas and dplyr) will have a clear understanding of the context for Polars, but this experience is not required to learn to Polars.
	This workshop will not cover the Python programming language directly. Some experience with python or R (or other scripted languages for data analysis) is likely to be very helpful.

We'll discuss starting points for obtaining data and work through examples that focus on social science data and feature (vector) layers, but attendees are encouraged to ask questions regarding their own needs and will be welcome to make one-on-one appointments later for more focused instruction. This is an introductory class, and it's not necessary to be familiar with GIS software beforehand. This event is open to non-Duke participants.

Attendees should have access to ArcGIS Pro. These are the options for Duke affiliates:

OIT Download: Current Duke University students, faculty, and staff can get a free copy to install on their own Windows computer, or a Mac with virtual machine software installed (e.g., VMware or Parallels).
	Virtual Computing Manager (VCM) from Duke's Office of Information Technology (OIT) allows Duke users to check out a virtual machine with ArcGIS installed and connect via a remote connection.
For non-Duke affiliates, if you don't have access to a licensed copy of ArcGIS Pro through your institution, you can install a free 21-day trial version to allow you to use the sample data and follow through the instructions in this workshop.

Intermediate Tableau: Visualizing Likert-scale survey data,"1:00pm Tuesday, February 11, 2025","2:30pm Tuesday, February 11, 2025",Eric Monson,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/13669137?hs=a,"[Online] Tableau is one of the easiest and most flexible programs for visualizing and exploring data. This exploration stage of visualization is essential for finding the patterns in your data that you want to investigate and communicate to your audience. Likert-scale survey data, where respondents have given answers on a scale about how much they agree with a statement, or how important something is to them (e.g. strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree) presents a wonderful example for learning intermediate Tableau skills!

What you’ll learn:

(Even if you don’t work with survey data, this workshop is a great, general intermediate Tableau training!) In this workshop we’ll transform survey data from the “wide” format it usually comes in to “tall” (pivot) in preparation for visualization, form “relationships” between multiple tables (like a database JOIN), and build some effective visualizations for Likert scale survey results (100% stacked bars, dual axis plots, and slope charts).

It’s not absolutely necessary, but if you’ve never used Tableau before, I would strongly recommend watching my Introduction to Tableau workshop video (https://warpwire.duke.edu/w/ye0GAA/) before attending.

R for Lunch: Larger than RAM computing with simplified SQL techniques and duckdb,"12:00pm Thursday, February 20, 2025","1:00pm Thursday, February 20, 2025",John Little,Bostock 127 (The Edge Workshop Room),https://duke.libcal.com/event/13664864?hs=a,"[In-person] Part of the RFun Series. We explore use cases of manipulating larger than RAM data, leveraging {dplyr} verbs to generate SQL queries, and {DBI} to broker connections to DuckDB.  Of interest especially when your R process is running out of memory, or you're interested in a practical application of Composable Data Systems. This event is open to non-Duke participants.

R for Lunch is a one-hour lunchtime series designed to help people learn R for reproducible computational thinking. R is a data science and data visualization tool which, when combined with RStudio, the Tidyverse, and Quarto, provides a powerful and flexible environment for reproducible research. 

NOTE:  Must have an up-to-date installation of RStudio.  (RStudio > Help > Check for Updates).  Must install.packages(""duckdb"") and the {tidyverse}

Topics covered will include a framework for analyzing ethical cases, the use of secondary data in research, working with human participants, senstive ecosystems, AI, and the impact of laws on data sharing. We will also explore the application of diversity and equity principles to open science and data sharing. For instance, how can researchers ethically collect, handle, and share data from certain communities, such as Indigenous People? This workshop will contain both lecture and small group discussion where participants will engage with key ethical concepts and apply those concepts to a case-study. This event is open to non-Duke participants.

In this workshop we'll take a very basic line chart and work together to make it much more effective through formatting and annotations in PowerPoint. Along the way you'll learn some basic but powerful techniques for customizing your charts, and for manipulating shapes and text in PowerPoint. 

This workshop is open to non-Duke participants.

Expectations:

If you're going to play along with the exercises, you'll have an easier time if you have two monitors. (Some people get by with one, but it's harder to watch me perform steps and do them at the same time if you only have one screen.)
	You will be expected to arrive with Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint already installed on the machine you're Zooming from if you want to work along with me or do the exercises during the workshop!

With the latest requirements coming in 2023 from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for Data Management and Sharing Plans (https://sharing.nih.gov/), there are legitimate concerns about how data from human beings can ethically and safely be shared. This workshop will talk about the various challenges that arise when considering how to share human participants data in DMSPs and potential ways that these challenges can be addressed, and even solved, with resources available at Duke and beyond (data sharing consent language, controlled access repositories, de-identification help, etc.). While services and help resources are still evolving at NIH, Duke and in related professional associations and academic discipline groups, you are not alone in determining how to share human participants data the right and ethical way.
