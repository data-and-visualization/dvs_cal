Tips for Effective Data Visualization,2023-09-11,6:00pm - 7:00pm,Eric Monson,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/11004239?hs=a,"[Online] Visualization is a powerful way to reveal patterns in data, attract attention, and get your message across to an audience quickly and clearly. But, there are many steps in that journey from exploration to information to influence, and many choices to make when putting it all together to tell your story. I will cover some basic guidelines for effective visualization, point out a few common pitfalls to avoid, and run through a critique and iterations of an existing visualization to help you start seeing better choices beyond the program defaults.

Intro to ArcGIS Pro,2023-09-13,10:00am - 12:00pm,Mark Thomas,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/11003805?hs=a,"[Online] ArcGIS Pro is the latest flagship desktop GIS client application from Esri.  Compared to the earlier ArcMap interface, it has superior performance as a native 64-bit program. There are a few nice feature enhancements such as multiple layouts in a single project, and it's more fully integrated with ArcGIS Online.

ArcGIS Pro can help you analyze or visualize digital data that has a locational component, and we'll discuss starting points for obtaining data. Examples will focus on social science data and feature (vector) layers, but attendees are encouraged to ask questions regarding their own needs and will be welcome to make one-on-one appointments later for more focused instruction. This is an introductory class, and it's not necessary to be familiar with GIS software beforehand. This event is open to non-Duke participants.

Attendees should have access to ArcGIS Pro. These are the options for Duke affiliates:

OIT Download: Current Duke University students, faculty, and staff can get a free copy to install on their own Windows computer, or a Mac with virtual machine software installed (e.g., VMware or Parallels).
	Virtual Computing Manager (VCM) from Duke's Office of Information Technology (OIT) allows Duke users to check out a virtual machine with ArcGIS installed and connect via a remote connection.
For non-Duke affiliates, if you don't have access to a licensed copy of ArcGIS Pro through your institution, you can install a free 21-day trial version to allow you to use the sample data and follow through the instructions in this workshop.

This event is offered virtually. A zoom link will be sent via email to registered participants to join the workshop.

This workshop will focus on using Tableau Public to create data visualizations, starting with an overview of how the program thinks about data, common data manipulation and loading, and the terminology used. Activities will include a sample data visualization and mapping project, which will give people hands-on experience using Tableau’s basic chart types and dashboard creation tools. We will also discuss publishing to the Tableau Public web server and related services and tools, like the full Tableau Desktop application (free for full-time students).

This workshop is designed for beginners who might be comfortable with data and spreadsheets, but have no experience with Tableau, are curious about what it can do, and want to get a quick introduction so they can start playing on their own. This event is open to non-Duke participants.

Expectations: 

If you need help with something during the session, you'll be expected to share your screen.
	You will be expected to arrive with Tableau Public or Desktop already installed on the machine you're Zooming from if you want to work along with me or do the exercises during the workshop!
	Tableau is available through the company itself, not OIT
		Tableau Public is free and available for Mac and Windows. Download at: https://www.tableau.com/products/public/download 
		Tableau Desktop licenses are free for students (Google ""Tableau for Students"") or those doing non-profit research (as defined by Tableau – Google ""Tableau for Teaching"")
		Please don't use the online Web Authoring version that just runs in your browser if you're planning to play along with the exercises – there are some differences that cause problems.

Mapping with R,2023-10-10,10:00am - 12:00pm,Drew Keener,Bostock 127 (The Edge Workshop Room),https://duke.libcal.com/event/11003775?hs=a,"[In-person] This workshop introduces the use of the R language for producing maps. We will demonstrate the advantages of a code-drive approach such as R for visualizing geospatial data. Participants will gain the skills to quickly and efficiently create a variety of map types for a website, presentation, or publication. In addition to working on hands-on coding exercises, we will also review practical guidance on designing effective maps.

Attendees will need basic familiarity with R and RStudio to follow along with the exercises. Knowledge of tidyverse packages such as ggplot2 and dplyr is also helpful. This event is open to non-Duke participants.

An Introduction to Reproducible Research Practices,2023-10-11,10:00am - 12:00pm,Sophia Lafferty-Hess & John Little,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/10998311?hs=a,"[Online] The importance of reproducibility, replication, and transparency in the research endeavor is increasingly discussed in academia. This workshop will introduce the concept of “reproducibility” and foundational strategies that can increase the reproducibility of your work particularly related to organization, documentation, literate coding techniques, version control, and archiving data and code for future access and use. We will also present a protocol, the TIER protocol, as a tool that graduate students or others can use that are first approaching reproducibility. In the second half of the workshop we will present a potential end-to-end reproducible workflow using git, RStudio, Binder, and Zenodo to demonstrate some of the concepts in practice. This event is open to non-Duke participants. 

This event is offered virtually. A zoom link will be sent via email to registered participants to join the workshop.

PowerPoint Skills for Diagrams,2023-11-01,10:00am - 12:00pm,Eric Monson,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/11004281?hs=a,"[Online] While Adobe Illustrator is my preferred software for producing diagrams, PowerPoint is quite full-featured and a great option for those who don't have access to Illustrator. Plus, any skills you gain drawing diagrams will help you create better presentation slides! In this workshop I'll cover basic shape creation and manipulation in Microsoft PowerPoint, including ways to make your own icons with shape combinations. This event is open to non-Duke participants. 

Expectations: 

If you need help with something during the session, you'll be expected to share your screen.
	You will be expected to arrive with Microsoft PowerPoint already installed on your computer if you want to work along with me or do the exercises during the workshop!

Preparing for Data Publishing: Standards and Disciplinary Repositories,2023-11-02,10:00am - 12:00pm,Sophia Lafferty-Hess & Jen Darragh,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/10998422?hs=a,"[Online] Research data have value beyond their original purpose and by sharing or ""publishing"" your data you can support open science, reproducibility, and future innovation. This workshop will explore strategies and best practices for formally publishing your data in a data repository. Topics covered will include new modes of publishing in academia, the use of data and metadata standards to support interoperability and harmonization, an overview of repository options and key features, examples of disciplinary repositories, and data publishing methods to increase the impact of research projects and support the FAIR Guiding Principles (i.e., Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). Participants will also practice finding and assessing data repositories via a hands-on exercise. This event is open to non-Duke participants.

Open Scholarship: Practices and Principles,2023-11-09,1:00pm - 3:00pm,"Jen Darragh, Sophia Lafferty-Hess & Paolo Mangiafico",Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/10998425?hs=a,"[Online] With the recent trends towards openness as expressed in funder and journal policies (such as the new OSTP memo focusing on Immediate and Equitable Access to  Federally Funded Research), many scholars are looking to build new practices into their workflows and enhance their impact. This workshop will present an overview of how and why you might incorporate open scholarship practices into your research and publishing, including the benefits to you, your discipline, and the broader public. It will also prepare you to meet new requirements being put in place by many funding agencies, and give you tools to make sure you can protect your rights and get credit for your work while sharing it broadly. This event is open to non-Duke participants.
