This workshop is designed for beginners who might be comfortable with data and spreadsheets, but have no experience with Tableau, are curious about what it can do, and want to get a quick introduction so they can start playing on their own.

NOTE: The following week I have another workshop called Assignment Tableau (https://duke.libcal.com/event/11646710) where we use the experience we've gained from this Intro to Tableau to try to complete an assignment with new data while I'll be there to answer questions. Consider signing up for that workshop, too!

Expectations: 

If you need help with something during the session, you'll be expected to share your screen.
	You will be expected to arrive with Tableau Public or Desktop already installed on the machine you're Zooming from if you want to work along with me or do the exercises during the workshop!
	Tableau is available through the company itself, not OIT
		Tableau Public is free and available for Mac and Windows. Please download, install, and use the desktop app and not the ""web authoring"" online version.
		Tableau Desktop licenses are free for students (Google ""Tableau for Students"") or those doing teaching or non-profit academic research (as defined by Tableau – Google ""Tableau for Teaching"") Be sure to apply for your license at least a week before the session, since it often takes a few days for Tableau to verify your student or teaching status and send you the license

Tableau Public (available for both Windows and Mac) is incredibly useful free software that allows individuals to quickly and easily explore their data with a wide variety of visual representations, as well as create interactive web-based visualization dashboards. My video from Spring 2022 focused on using Tableau Public to create data visualizations, starting with an overview of how the program thinks about data, common data manipulation and loading, and the terminology used. Activities included a sample data visualization and mapping project, for hands-on experience using Tableau’s basic chart types and dashboard creation tools. I also discussed publishing to the Tableau Public web server and related services and tools, like the full Tableau Desktop application (free for full-time students). Watch that video before coming to this work session if you're not familiar with Tableau!

This work time is designed to give you a chance to try to use Tableau Public or Desktop for data exploration and visualization, along with others at a similar introductory level, and in an environment where I can answer questions live.

Expectations: 

If you need help with something during the session, you'll be expected to share your screen.
	You will be expected to arrive with Tableau Public or Desktop already installed on the machine you're Zooming from if you want to work along with me or do the exercises during the workshop!
	Tableau is available through the company itself, not OIT
		Tableau Public is free and available for Mac and Windows. Please download, install, and use the desktop app and not the ""web authoring"" online version.
		Tableau Desktop licenses are free for students (Google ""Tableau for Students"") or those doing teaching or non-profit academic research (as defined by Tableau – Google ""Tableau for Teaching"") Be sure to apply for your license at least a week before the session, since it often takes a few days for Tableau to verify your student or teaching status and send you the license
