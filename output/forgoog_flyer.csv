Meeting Data Management and Sharing Plan Requirements,"Tue, Jan 14",01:00 PM,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/13595157,"There are many federal and private funders who require data management (and sharing) plans as part of a grant application. NIH implemented a new Data Management and Sharing Policy in early 2023 and other funding agencies, such as NSF, are implementing revised public access and data sharing policies in early 2025 to comply with the “Nelson Memo.” This workshop will cover the components of a data management and sharing plan, what makes a strong plan and how to adhere to it, and where to find guidance, tools, resources, and assistance for building funder-based plans. We will also discuss how to make data management plans actionable and meaningful living documents to support research integrity, reproducibility, reuse, and verification of results. This workshop is a collaboration of Duke University Libraries, the Office of Scientific Integrity, and the Medical Center Libraries and Archives. This event is open to non-Duke participants.

This workshop is eligible for 2 hours of Graduate School RCR Credit and 200-level faculty and staff RCR.

Intro to ArcGIS Pro,"Wed, Jan 29",01:00 PM,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/13673155,"ArcGIS Pro is the flagship desktop GIS client application from Esri that helps you analyze or visualize digital data that has a locational component. Compared to the previous ArcMap interface (no longer available through Duke), it has superior performance as a native 64-bit program. There are a few nice feature enhancements such as multiple layouts in a single project, and it's more fully integrated with ArcGIS Online. We'll discuss starting points for obtaining data and work through examples that focus on social science data and feature (vector) layers, but attendees are encouraged to ask questions regarding their own needs and will be welcome to make one-on-one appointments later for more focused instruction. This is an introductory class, and it's not necessary to be familiar with GIS software beforehand. This event is open to non-Duke participants.

Attendees should have access to ArcGIS Pro. These are the options for Duke affiliates:

OIT Download: Current Duke University students, faculty, and staff can get a free copy to install on their own Windows computer, or a Mac with virtual machine software installed (e.g., VMware or Parallels).
	Virtual Computing Manager (VCM) from Duke's Office of Information Technology (OIT) allows Duke users to check out a virtual machine with ArcGIS installed and connect via a remote connection.
For non-Duke affiliates, if you don't have access to a licensed copy of ArcGIS Pro through your institution, you can install a free 21-day trial version to allow you to use the sample data and follow through the instructions in this workshop.

Intro to Tableau: Easy charts and maps,"Tue, Feb 04",01:00 PM,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/13668624,"Tableau Public (available for both Windows and Mac) is incredibly useful free software that allows individuals to quickly and easily explore their data with a wide variety of visual representations, as well as create interactive web-based visualization dashboards. This workshop will focus on using Tableau Public to create data visualizations, starting with an overview of how the program thinks about data, common data manipulation and loading, and the terminology used. Activities will include a sample data visualization and mapping project, which will give people hands-on experience using Tableau’s basic chart types and dashboard creation tools. We will also discuss publishing to the Tableau Public web server and related services and tools, like the full Tableau Desktop application (free for full-time students). This event is open to non-Duke participants.

This workshop is designed for beginners who might be comfortable with data and spreadsheets, but have no experience with Tableau, are curious about what it can do, and want to get a quick introduction so they can start playing on their own.

Expectations: 

If you're going to play along with the exercises, you'll have an easier time if you have two monitors. (Some people get by with one, but it's harder to watch me perform steps and do them at the same time if you only have one screen.)
	You will be expected to arrive with Tableau Public or Desktop already installed on the machine you're Zooming from if you want to work along with me or do the exercises during the workshop!
	Tableau is available through the company itself, not OIT
		Tableau Public is free and available for Mac and Windows. Please download, install, and use the desktop app and not the ""web authoring"" online version.
		Tableau Desktop licenses are free for students (Google ""Tableau for Students"") or those doing teaching or non-profit academic research (as defined by Tableau – Google ""Tableau for Teaching"") Be sure to apply for your license at least a week before the session, since it often takes a few days for Tableau to verify your student or teaching status and send you the license

An Introduction to Reproducible Research Practices,"Tue, Feb 11",10:00 AM,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/13595140,"The importance of reproducibility, replication, and transparency in the research endeavor is increasingly discussed in academia. This workshop will introduce the concept of “reproducibility” and foundational strategies that can increase the reproducibility of your work particularly related to organization, documentation, literate coding techniques, version control, and archiving data and code for future access and use. We will also present a protocol, the TIER protocol, as a tool that graduate students or others can use that are first approaching reproducibility. In the second half of the workshop we will present a potential end-to-end reproducible workflow using git, RStudio, Binder, and Zenodo to demonstrate some of the concepts in practice.

Intermediate Tableau: Visualizing Likert-scale survey data,"Tue, Feb 11",01:00 PM,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/13669137,"Tableau is one of the easiest and most flexible programs for visualizing and exploring data. This exploration stage of visualization is essential for finding the patterns in your data that you want to investigate and communicate to your audience. Likert-scale survey data, where respondents have given answers on a scale about how much they agree with a statement, or how important something is to them (e.g. strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree) presents a wonderful example for learning intermediate Tableau skills!

What you’ll learn:

(Even if you don’t work with survey data, this workshop is a great, general intermediate Tableau training!) In this workshop we’ll transform survey data from the “wide” format it usually comes in to “tall” (pivot) in preparation for visualization, form “relationships” between multiple tables (like a database JOIN), and build some effective visualizations for Likert scale survey results (100% stacked bars, dual axis plots, and slope charts).

It’s not absolutely necessary, but if you’ve never used Tableau before, I would strongly recommend watching my Introduction to Tableau workshop video (https://warpwire.duke.edu/w/ye0GAA/) before attending.

This event is open to non-Duke participants.

Expectations: 

If you're going to play along with the exercises, you'll have an easier time if you have two monitors. (Some people get by with one, but it's harder to watch me perform steps and do them at the same time if you only have one screen.)

Sharing Human Participants Data: Challenges and (Potential) Solutions,"Thu, Mar 13",02:00 PM,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/13595459,"The sharing of research data has become increasingly important to federal and private funders and journal publishers for a number of reasons (research transparency, reproducibility, return on investment, new research on existing data, etc.). With the latest requirements coming in 2023 from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for Data Management and Sharing Plans (https://sharing.nih.gov/), there are legitimate concerns about how data from human beings can ethically and safely be shared. This workshop will talk about the various challenges that arise when considering how to share human participants data in DMSPs and potential ways that these challenges can be addressed, and even solved, with resources available at Duke and beyond (data sharing consent language, controlled access repositories, de-identification help, etc.).
