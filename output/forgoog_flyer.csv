Good data management practices pertaining to planning, organization, documentation, storage and backup, sharing, citation, and preservation will be presented using examples that span disciplines. The second hour of this workshop will offer a mini “tour” of research data management tools including GitHub, LabArchives, and OSF and provide a framework for considering how to assess data management tools for future adoption. 

This workshop contains similar material to the previously offered “Research Data Management 101” workshop offered in previous semesters - participants who have attended this previous workshop should not attend.

9994067,"Wednesday, Jan 18 10:00am - 12:00pm",Intro to ArcGIS Pro,Mark Thomas,[Online],https://duke.libcal.com/event/9994067,"ArcGIS Pro is the newer alternative interface to the tried-and-true ArcGIS Desktop software (ArcMap), with essentially the same functions, but with more of a MS-Office feel. As a native 64-bit program, it also has superior performance. There are a few nice feature enhancements such as multiple layouts in a single project, and it's more fully integrated with ArcGIS Online.

ArcGIS Pro can help you analyze or visualize digital data that has a locational component, and we'll discuss starting points for obtaining data. Examples will focus on social science data and feature (vector) layers, but attendees are encouraged to ask questions regarding their own needs and will be welcome to make one-on-one appointments later for more focused instruction. This is an introductory class, and it's not necessary to be familiar with GIS software beforehand.

Attendees should have access to ArcGIS Pro. These are the options for Duke affiliates:

OIT Download: Current Duke University students, faculty, and staff can get a free copy to install on their own Windows computer, or a Mac with virtual machine software installed (e.g., VMware or Parallels).
	Virtual Computing Manager (VCM) from Duke's Office of Information Technology (OIT) allows Duke users to check out a virtual machine with ArcGIS installed and connect via a remote connection.
For non-Duke affiliates, if you don't have access to a licensed copy of ArcGIS Pro through your institution, you can install a free 21-day trial version to allow you to use the sample data and follow through the instructions in this workshop.

Is it a workflow?  Is it a web hosting environment?  Fundamentally Quarto is an approach to reproducible workflows that are especially useful when reporting outputs derived from scientific and technical computation.

In this demonstration we will compose visual reports using computational notebooks.   Using an open-source visual editor we will compose text peppered with code-chunks.  Outputs can inlude articles, reports, websites, books, slide-decks, PDF, MS Word, ePub, etc. Quarto conveniently accommodates equations, figures, advanced layouts, citations, and more.  If you use Python, R, Julia, ObservableJS, Jupyter notebooks, or VS Code, Quarto is an efficient way to document and exectute your research while dynamically generating reports.

Topics covered will include a framework for analyzing ethical cases, the use of secondary data in research, proper consent procedures, de-identification, and the impact of laws on data sharing. We will also explore the application of diversity and equity principles to open science and data sharing. For instance, how can researchers ethically collect, handle, and share data from certain communities, such as Indigenous People?

This is an intermediate-level, live teaching session where you will learn how to use the Pandas module for exploring tablular (spreadsheet) data using the groupby() and pivot_table() functions, as well as some visualizations of results.

Python can be a great option for exploration, analysis and visualization of tabular data, such as spreadsheets and CSV files, if you know which tools to use and how to get started. This workshop builds upon the introductory Pandas 101 & 102 workshops I gave in Spring 2022 & Fall 2022. (Code repository. See below for recordings.) In Pandas 101, I covered the very basics of how to access your data in a Panda DataFrame and do some basic plotting. In Pandas 102, I introduced how to get data into a ""tidy"" form, and merge datasets (like doing an SQL JOIN). In this Pandas 103, I will show you some of the way you can explore patterns in data by aggretating across categories and time. This is similar to the process of data exploration in Tableau, but here with Python, Pandas and JupyterLab.

If you don't have any programming experience, or you have never used Python at all before, the material may be too confusing to be useful. I won't be teaching the language itself. 
	If you have at least a little bit of Python exposure, but haven't used Pandas much or at all, I would advise watching at least the Spring 2020 Pandas 102 video before you attend. If you find that too advanced, or want a more complete introduction to Pandas, start instead with the Spring 2022 Pandas 101 video.
Expectations: 

You will be expected to have your video on for at least part of the session, although we won't be doing any group work or sharing.
	If you need help with something during the session, you'll be expected to share your screen.
	You will be expected to arrive with the Anaconda Python distribution already installed on the machine you're Zooming from if you want to work along with me or do the exercises during the workshop!
	They now call this the Anaconda Individual Edition, available for Mac, Windows, or LInux
		I would advise installing just for yourself, not for all users (installs in your Users directory, and doesn't need administrator priviledges)
		I will hold open Zoom walk-in hours for an hour before the workshop to help remotely troubleshoot installation issues. Email me at emonson@duke.edu to get the URL.

This workshop will introduce the concept of “reproducibility” and foundational strategies that can increase the reproducibility of your work particularly related to organization, documentation, literate coding techniques, version control, and archiving data and code for future access and use. We will also present a protocol, the TIER protocol, as a tool that graduate students or others can use that are first approaching reproducibility. In the second half of the workshop we will present a potential end-to-end reproducible workflow using git, RStudio, Binder, and Zenodo to demonstrate some of the concepts in practice.
