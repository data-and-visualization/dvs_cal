ArcGIS Pro can help you analyze or visualize digital data that has a locational component, and we'll discuss starting points for obtaining data. Examples will focus on social science data and feature (vector) layers, but attendees are encouraged to ask questions regarding their own needs and will be welcome to make one-on-one appointments later for more focused instruction. This is an introductory class, and it's not necessary to be familiar with GIS software beforehand. This event is open to non-Duke participants.

Attendees should have access to ArcGIS Pro. These are the options for Duke affiliates:

OIT Download: Current Duke University students, faculty, and staff can get a free copy to install on their own Windows computer, or a Mac with virtual machine software installed (e.g., VMware or Parallels).
	Virtual Computing Manager (VCM) from Duke's Office of Information Technology (OIT) allows Duke users to check out a virtual machine with ArcGIS installed and connect via a remote connection.
For non-Duke affiliates, if you don't have access to a licensed copy of ArcGIS Pro through your institution, you can install a free 21-day trial version to allow you to use the sample data and follow through the instructions in this workshop.

Sharing Human Participants Data: Challenges and (Potential) Solutions,"Tue, Feb 13",2:00pm - 4:00pm,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/11642942,"The sharing of research data has become increasingly important to federal and private funders and journal publishers for a number of reasons (research transparency, reproducibility, return on investment, new research on existing data, etc.). With the latest requirements coming in 2023 from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for Data Management and Sharing Plans (https://sharing.nih.gov/), there are legitimate concerns about how data from human beings can ethically and safely be shared. This workshop will talk about the various challenges that arise when considering how to share human participants data in DMSPs and potential ways that these challenges can be addressed, and even solved, with resources available at Duke and beyond (data sharing consent language, controlled access repositories, de-identification help, etc.). While services and help resources are still evolving at NIH, Duke and in related professional associations and academic discipline groups, you are not alone in determining how to share human participants data the right and ethical way.

This workshop is designed for beginners who might be comfortable with data and spreadsheets, but have no experience with Tableau, are curious about what it can do, and want to get a quick introduction so they can start playing on their own.

NOTE: The following week I have another workshop called Assignment Tableau (https://duke.libcal.com/event/11646710) where we use the experience we've gained from this Intro to Tableau to try to complete an assignment with new data while I'll be there to answer questions. Consider signing up for that workshop, too!

Expectations: 

If you need help with something during the session, you'll be expected to share your screen.
	You will be expected to arrive with Tableau Public or Desktop already installed on the machine you're Zooming from if you want to work along with me or do the exercises during the workshop!
	Tableau is available through the company itself, not OIT
		Tableau Public is free and available for Mac and Windows. Please download, install, and use the desktop app and not the ""web authoring"" online version.
		Tableau Desktop licenses are free for students (Google ""Tableau for Students"") or those doing teaching or non-profit academic research (as defined by Tableau – Google ""Tableau for Teaching"") Be sure to apply for your license at least a week before the session, since it often takes a few days for Tableau to verify your student or teaching status and send you the license
