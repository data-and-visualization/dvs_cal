Topics covered will include a framework for analyzing ethical cases, the use of secondary data in research, proper consent procedures, de-identification, and the impact of laws on data sharing. We will also explore the application of diversity and equity principles to open science and data sharing. For instance, how can researchers ethically collect, handle, and share data from certain communities, such as Indigenous People? This workshop will contain both lecture and small group discussion where participants will engage with key ethical concepts and apply those concepts to a case-study.

In this workshop we will demonstrate how to import and analyze data in QGIS and discuss the benefits of using QGIS over other GIS software. In the process, we'll go over some general GIS concepts such as layers, types of GIS files, and projections, with an emphasis on feature (vector) layers. This is an introductory class, and no prior GIS experience is needed.

Attendees should have installed QGIS beforehand.

Go to the QGIS Downloads webpage.
	Download and install the QGIS Installer for either the latest version or the latest long-term (most stable) release, either 64-bit or 32-bit.  Versions for several platforms are available.

As a native 64-bit program, it also has superior performance. There are a few nice feature enhancements such as multiple layouts in a single project, and it's more fully integrated with ArcGIS Online (see schedule for workshops on ArcGIS Online or on StoryMaps).

ArcGIS Pro can help you analyze or visualize digital data that has a locational component, and we'll discuss starting points for obtaining data. Examples will focus on social science data and feature (vector) layers, but attendees are encouraged to ask questions regarding their own needs and will be welcome to make one-on-one appointments later for more focused instruction. This is an introductory class, and it's not necessary to be familiar with GIS software beforehand.

Attendees should have access to ArcGIS Pro. These are the options for Duke affiliates:

OIT Download: Current Duke University students, faculty, and staff can get a free copy to install on their own Windows computer, or a Mac with virtual machine software installed (e.g., VMware or Parallels).

This workshop will introduce the concept of “reproducibility” and foundational strategies that can increase the reproducibility of your work particularly related to organization, documentation, literate coding techniques, version control, and archiving data and code for future access and use. We will also present a protocol, the TIER protocol, as a tool that graduate students or others can use that are first approaching reproducibility. This workshop will primarily be tool agnostic and instead focusing on the high level practices that can be applied across disciplines and workflows with representative examples.

It also has an increasing number of capabilities to create maps. In this workshop, will introduce some of the mapping features in Tableau. Participants will learn how to create several types of maps from geospatial datasets and tabular data that include locational values, such as place names or coordinates. We will also discuss best practices for designing effective maps.

To maximize the amount of hands-on time working with Tableau, participants are expected to watch recorded instruction that we will share prior to the workshop. During the workshop time we will work together on a few assignments to practice the materiel covered in the tutorial video. This work time is designed to give you a chance to try to use Tableau Public or Desktop to create interactive maps, along with others at a similar level, in an environment where you can ask questions live.

Duke students at are eligible for a free one-year license to activate Tableau Desktop. Faculty and staff may also request a free license to use for teaching and non-commercial academic research. Be aware that it can take a few days to receive your academic license. A free Public Edition is also available to everyone.

This workshop will take you through some practical examples of using Python and specifically the Pandas module to load data from files, access that data, and start visualizing it with the Pandas built-in plotting functions. You will also get some experience working in JupyterLab, the flexible programming environment which contain Jupyter Notebooks, a file browser, and more.

Note: This is an introductory workshop on the Pandas module, but you’ll probably be more comfortable following along if you have at least a little bit of experience using the Python programming language, since I won’t be spending time on the language itself. (Feel free to sign up no matter what your experience level, but past students with no Python or programming experience have found it too confusing to be useful.)

Anaconda Python distribution (Individual Edition): https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

I strongly recommend that you install the Anaconda Python Distribution to use in class. In principle, if you have something above Python 3.7 or so, plus all the necessary modules, everything should work fine. But, the Anaconda Distribution is packaged nicely, can be installed without admin privileges, and comes with everything you’ll need. If you have another version of Python already installed and you’re going to install Anaconda, it’s best to uninstall the other version first. It can get to be a mess if you have multiple versions of Python installed on one machine. 

Go to the link above, hit Download, and choose the version for your operating system. I would recommend to just install for “yourself”, not for all users of the machine, since that way it will install everything in your Users/username folder and doesn’t require admin privileges. 

If you’re on Mac and aren’t comfortable with shell scripts on the command line, choose the Graphical Installer. 

On Windows, I would choose the 64-bit installer, unless you know you’re still running a 32-bit version of Windows on an older machine. 

If you’re sticking with your non-Anaconda version of Python, make sure you have JupyterLab, Pandas, and all of their respective dependencies installed.

Please try to launch Python and JupyterLab before class to make sure they’re working! JupyterLab can be started from the Anaconda Navigator application, or from the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or a Terminal (Mac) by typing (without quotes) “jupyter lab” and hitting return. From a Python notebook or an interactive Python prompt, you can test out the main modules you’ll need by typing this and executing the code cell:

import pandas as pd
