Intro to ArcGIS Pro,"Wed, Sep 13",10:00am - 12:00pm,Online,https://duke.libcal.com/event/11003805,"ArcGIS Pro is the latest flagship desktop GIS client application from Esri.  Compared to the earlier ArcMap interface, it has superior performance as a native 64-bit program. There are a few nice feature enhancements such as multiple layouts in a single project, and it's more fully integrated with ArcGIS Online.

ArcGIS Pro can help you analyze or visualize digital data that has a locational component, and we'll discuss starting points for obtaining data. Examples will focus on social science data and feature (vector) layers, but attendees are encouraged to ask questions regarding their own needs and will be welcome to make one-on-one appointments later for more focused instruction. This is an introductory class, and it's not necessary to be familiar with GIS software beforehand. This event is open to non-Duke participants.

Attendees should have access to ArcGIS Pro. These are the options for Duke affiliates:

OIT Download: Current Duke University students, faculty, and staff can get a free copy to install on their own Windows computer, or a Mac with virtual machine software installed (e.g., VMware or Parallels).
	Virtual Computing Manager (VCM) from Duke's Office of Information Technology (OIT) allows Duke users to check out a virtual machine with ArcGIS installed and connect via a remote connection.
For non-Duke affiliates, if you don't have access to a licensed copy of ArcGIS Pro through your institution, you can install a free 21-day trial version to allow you to use the sample data and follow through the instructions in this workshop.
