But, there are many steps in that journey from exploration to information to influence, and many choices to make when putting it all together to tell your story. I will cover some basic guidelines for effective visualization, point out a few common pitfalls to avoid, and run through a critique and iterations of an existing visualization to help you start seeing better choices beyond the program defaults.

As a native 64-bit program, it also has superior performance. There are a few nice feature enhancements such as multiple layouts in a single project, and it's more fully integrated with ArcGIS Online.

ArcGIS Pro can help you analyze or visualize digital data that has a locational component, and we'll discuss starting points for obtaining data. Examples will focus on social science data and feature (vector) layers, but attendees are encouraged to ask questions regarding their own needs and will be welcome to make one-on-one appointments later for more focused instruction. This is an introductory class, and it's not necessary to be familiar with GIS software beforehand.

Attendees should have access to ArcGIS Pro. These are the options for Duke affiliates:

OIT Download: Current Duke University students, faculty, and staff can get a free copy to install on their own Windows computer, or a Mac with virtual machine software installed (e.g., VMware or Parallels).
	Virtual Computing Manager (VCM) from Duke's Office of Information Technology (OIT) allows Duke users to check out a virtual machine with ArcGIS installed and connect via a remote connection.
For non-Duke affiliates, if you don't have access to a licensed copy of ArcGIS Pro through your institution, you can install a free 21-day trial version to allow you to use the sample data and follow through the instructions in this workshop.

Attendees are expected to watch my Intro to Tableau Spring 2022 video first, or have some experience with Tableau. This will be an opportunity to work together on the assignment from the end of that workshop, plus have questions answered live.

Tableau Public (available for both Windows and Mac) is incredibly useful free software that allows individuals to quickly and easily explore their data with a wide variety of visual representations, as well as create interactive web-based visualization dashboards. My video from Spring 2022 focused on using Tableau Public to create data visualizations, starting with an overview of how the program thinks about data, common data manipulation and loading, and the terminology used. Activities included a sample data visualization and mapping project, for hands-on experience using Tableau’s basic chart types and dashboard creation tools. I also discussed publishing to the Tableau Public web server and related services and tools, like the full Tableau Desktop application (free for full-time students). Watch that video before coming to this work session if you're not familiar with Tableau!

This work time is designed to give you a chance to try to use Tableau Public or Desktop for data exploration and visualization, along with others at a similar introductory level, and in an environment where I can answer questions live.

You will be expected to have your video on for most of the session, and to potentially share your screen during part of the work time.
	You will be expected to arrive with Tableau Desktop or Public 2022 already installed on the machine you're Zooming from. 
	I will hold open Zoom walk-in hours for an hour before the workshop to help remotely troubleshoot installation issues. Email me at emonson@duke.edu to get the URL.
		If you're applying for a free student license for Tableau Desktop, be sure to do that a week before the session, since it often takes a few days for Tableau to verify your student status and send you the license

Attendees are expected to watch my Python for Data Science: Pandas 101 spring 2022 video first, or have some previous experience with both Python and Pandas. This will be an opportunity to work together on the assignment we didn't have time for at the end of that workshop, plus have questions answered live. The assignment will be very basic, covering DataFrame access and simple built-in Pandas plotting.

Python can be a great option for exploration, analysis and visualization of tabular data, such as spreadsheets and CSV files, if you know which tools to use and how to get started. My spring 2022 Pandas 101 video takes you through some practical examples of using Python and specifically the Pandas module to load data from files, access that data, and start visualizing it with the Pandas built-in plotting functions. It also gives you a quick introduction to working in JupyterLab, the flexible programming environment which contain Jupyter Notebooks, a file browser, and more.

Anaconda Python distribution (Individual Edition): https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

I strongly recommend that you install the Anaconda Python Distribution to use in class. In principle, if you have something above Python 3.8 or so, plus all the necessary modules, everything should work fine. But, the Anaconda Distribution is packaged nicely, can be installed without admin privileges, and comes with everything you’ll need. If you have another version of Python already installed and you’re going to install Anaconda, it’s best to uninstall the other version first. It can get to be a mess if you have multiple versions of Python installed on one machine. 

Go to the link above, hit Download, and choose the version for your operating system. I would recommend to just install for “yourself”, not for all users of the machine, since that way it will install everything in your Users/username folder and doesn’t require admin privileges. 

If you’re on Mac and aren’t comfortable with shell scripts on the command line, choose the Graphical Installer. 

On Windows, I would choose the 64-bit installer, unless you know you’re still running a 32-bit version of Windows on an older machine. 

If you’re sticking with your non-Anaconda version of Python, make sure you have JupyterLab, Pandas, and all of their respective dependencies installed.

Please try to launch Python and JupyterLab before class to make sure they’re working! JupyterLab can be started from the Anaconda Navigator application, or from the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or a Terminal (Mac) by typing (without quotes) “jupyter lab” and hitting return. From a Python notebook or an interactive Python prompt, you can test out the main modules you’ll need by typing this and executing the code cell:

import pandas as pd

Go to the link above, hit Download, and choose the version for your operating system. I would recommend to just install for “yourself”, not for all users of the machine, since that way it will install everything in your Users/username folder and doesn’t require admin privileges. 

If you’re on Mac and aren’t comfortable with shell scripts on the command line, choose the Graphical Installer. 

On Windows, I would choose the 64-bit installer, unless you know you’re still running a 32-bit version of Windows on an older machine. 

If you’re sticking with your non-Anaconda version of Python, make sure you have JupyterLab, Pandas, Seaborn, and all of their respective dependencies installed.

Please try to launch Python and JupyterLab before class to make sure they’re working! JupyterLab can be started from the Anaconda Navigator application, or from the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or a Terminal (Mac) by typing (without quotes) “jupyter lab” and hitting return. From a Python notebook or an interactive Python prompt, you can test out the main modules you’ll need by typing this and executing the code cell:

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

A zoom link will be sent via email to registered participants to join the workshop.

The content of the workshop may be recorded. If you are uncomfortable with a recording being published please contact the instructor at anytime prior to the conclusion of the workshop.
