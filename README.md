# DVS Calendar

This repository contains a mixture of handy scripts and datasets used by [Data and Visualization Services](library.duke.edu/data) in the process of marketing, assessing, and managing our [DVS Workshop Series](library.duke.edu/news).

This repository is a work in progress, but current contents include:

* **dvs_cal.Rmd** - a handy script if you'd like to see our Fall 2017 Workshop Series as a dataframe
* **rvestLibcalCode.R** - In DVS, we use Springshare's LibCal service to manage our registrations and workshop descriptions- this script pulls the current list of public workshops into a dataframe for further management and analysis (warning - the list will only reflect upcoming workshops.  If you need to see workshops since the fall of 2017, check out other scripts in this repository that will generate dataframes by semester.)
