# DVS Calendar

This repository contains a mixture of handy scripts and datasets used by [Data and Visualization Services](library.duke.edu/data) in the process of marketing, assessing, and managing our [DVS Workshop Series](library.duke.edu/news).

This repository is a work in progress, but current contents include:

* **dvs_cal.Rmd** - a handy script if you'd like to see our Fall 2017 and Spring 2018 Workshop Series as data frames
* **rvestLibcalCode.R** - In DVS, we use Springshare's LibCal service to manage our registrations and workshop descriptions- this script pulls the current list of public workshops into a data frame for further management and analysis (warning - the list will only reflect upcoming workshops.  If you need to see workshops since the fall of 2017, check out the dvs_cal.Rmd script which will generate dataframes by semester.)
